<h4>Core of VR1</h4>
<p>Challenging the conventional and rigid NGO structures, VR1 has been a force in itself, which addresses the dormant strength in every tangible and intangible entities, reckon the fine formulae which makes everyone around us thriving and capable of making a difference locally, socially and globally. The basic theme behind every work remains “Community Feeling” and so far it has been working wonders in every activity, every effort rendered by VR1.</p>

Rendering the concern for the Community, the best part which our policy brings out is it makes every being independent, a progressively thinking person, doing and acting practically, for the self for the society, and for the very Mother Nature.

<p>A few steps to start with</p>

<h4>Education</h4>
<p>Identifying, encouraging and promoting deprived, under-age, deserving children for Studies. Our target audience is not limited, we have beneficiaries embraced from Tea-Stalls, Streets, Beggars, children of House Maids, and sometimes as good as students from well-to-do families who have lost their track. We have means and methods, guidelines and a holistic sensible approach to convert and divert the delicate minds to the right path of their life and their career ahead.
Track record of our efforts suggests, this challenging task is turning out to be very exciting and tempting among our learned and dedicated volunteers. We believe in and we help the tender, young, and future generation to play, learn, grow and smile! We have provided a number scholarships to deserving and potential cases, and of all scholarship cases, the result has been so a soul-satisfying.
Healthcare, the deprived and elderly
Planned the Medical-camp twice in a year in well-known hospitals by specialist doctors especially for the poor & backward class of the society.
Special medical camps for the old age people at a very concessional fees for the Medical Surgeries like “Cataract”, free medical check-up and even necessary medicines have also been given.
Art, Poetry, Satire and Social strengthening
Our revolutionary idea of devising “Kavi-Sammlen” (Poetry & Satire) as one of our regular activities has proven to be a magical result in the higher class of society. Some eminent national figures from the Art, Poetry, and Literature frequent this annual event every year and themes and concept of this programme of Kavi Sammelan, creations from these artists have been thought provoking, they have thoroughly sensitized the one and all, who holds authority, chair and power, in small or big capacity, at any level.
Our motive has been to bring out and present the reality, check the pain and troubles the mass, the ordinary people face, which is often not known or which is neglected by those on the top. We with dedicated support from the valued poets, reach to the heart of people, and we do not just stop here. Revenue generated from donations and sponsorships goes to those who need it.
On the road
Distribution of Blankets and few other essentials to the beggars and to those many deprived who have the footpath as their bed in the night. We peculiarly undertake this task during Winters and dark-chilling nights
The Journey Ahead
We can sense the young generation is often losing the track, we feel women’s strength is mislead, altogether there are alarming social issues which questions woman’s present state in today’s modern world. In a country like India, very much till end of last millennium, a few issues were just non-existent and suddenly the society is getting exposed to cases of suicide, psycho-social disorders, neglect of elderly, troubled joint family system, child abuse, lawlessness, misuse of civic rights, pollution and threats to environment. Quite a some issues are really new and our aim is to work at root level, at ground level, to spread the word by mouth after the deeds and actions rendered by our hands. Spreading awareness and inviting & assisting like minded individuals and agencies is what the VR1 Foundation is headed for.

Over the years, the VR1 has gradually undertaken a few very innovative projects and missions and we aim at covering a few more over the next year upon completion of our ongoing projects. We have our scope specific yet very flexible and proud moment for VR1 at this juncture is it has been capable to think of, organize and render some rare concepts in the fields of :

Social Services
Environment
Health Care
Education
We have just started and together we stand better, together we are one. Let’s be there!</p>
